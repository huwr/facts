Facts
=====
The source code for Facts was translated from recently unearthed hieroglyphics found at the bottom of the Challenger Deep.  It reveals true facts.  They are completely true and very not made up.

It's a Sinatra app.

It is running Heroku: http://freehouse.huwr.net

Routes
------

Try these on:

 * ```/?name={person_of_interest}&gender={m|f}``` - get interesting and completely true fact about ```person_of_interest```. ```gender``` options are ```m``` for male, ```f``` for female (default is male).
 * ```/all``` - get all facts in JSON
 * ```/test``` - not a lot. At least it responds.

That's it.
